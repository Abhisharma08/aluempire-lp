## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#22222A) to create a sophisticated and modern feel. It will act as a neutral backdrop, allowing other design elements to pop. Changed to Black.
- Primary color: Gold (#FFC107) to highlight key elements and add a touch of luxury and professionalism. Changed to Orange.
- Accent color: Soft Blue (#ADD8E6) as an analogous hue to gold. It provides a pleasant contrast to the gold. Changed to White.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif with an elegant, high-end feel, is great for headlines.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability in longer text blocks, complementing the sophisticated headlines.
- Minimalist line icons in gold (#FFC107) to represent different services and categories. Changed to Orange.
- A clean and spacious layout with clear section divisions to guide the user's eye.
- Subtle fade-in animations on scroll to add a touch of dynamism.
